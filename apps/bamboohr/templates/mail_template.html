    <p>Hello, The integration failed to import {number_of_employees} employees from Bamboo HR to Fyle because of the lack of email addresses. We have attached the list of these employees below for your reference. Email address is mandatory for an employee record to be created in Fyle. Could you kindly add an email address for these employees? Once done, in the next sync, the integration will automatically pick up these records from Bamboo HR and create employees in Fyle.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an auto-generated email, do not respond to this email. If you have any questions, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@fylehq.com">support@fylehq.com</a>.</p>
